# DRAFT Statement of Objectives
## Smithsonian Institution National Museum of African American Museum of African American History and Culture
## Slavery and Freedom Digital Miminum Viable Product
### PROBLEM STATEMENT

SI NMAAHC's slavery and freedom exhibit is limited in both the amount of people it can reach and the quantity of objects, artifacts, information and stories it can share with others. Only so many are able to visit the exhibit in Washington, DC, and the physical constraints of the exhibit only allow for a finite amount of objects, artifacts, information and stories.  

_vendors - What questions do you have about this problem statement?_

### PRODUCT VISION

Our digital product creates for the world (is this our users?) an engaging, emotional and educational digital experience of NMAAHC's (and partners?) body of knowledge for slavery and freedom (that took place in the United States of America between 1400 and 1877?), in a way that promotes discovery in an inclusive way, increases empathy, and helps understand our world (or just our country?) today.  
_note: the above product vision was developed using key ideas coming out of the invididual product visions co-designed on 6/6/2019. vendors - What questions do you have about the product vision? What do you need further clarity on?_

### BACKGROUND

The Smithsonian Instituion's National Museum of African American History and Culture ... (NMAAHC to fill in content here)  

End users are not yet identified. However, NMAAHC has several hypotheses, including the following:  
* Would be museum visitors who find it difficult to physically travel to the museum
* Visitors of the physical museum who would like to further experience the exhibit afterwards
* K-12th grade classrooms that would like to leverage the exhibit although physically visiting the museum is difficult
However, the above-mentioned hypothetical users should not be understood as the actual, or only, end users. The scope of the anticipated contract(s) will require the vendor to conduct discover and user research to assist in a more clear identification of end users.

This project will be executed in a manner consistent with best practices from the Digital Services Playbook(1) and the TechFAR Handbook(2). The vendor will provide a cross-functional team of software engineers, user researchers, designers, and product managers to drive the repeatable process for the delivery of a functional software minimum viable product that is pleasing to end users.

_vendors - what additional background information would you like?_

### DEFINITIONS

Attorney/Advisor: SI employee with the authority to contractually bind the agency  
MVP: Minimum Viable Product  
NMAAHC: National Museum of African American History and Culture  
SI: Smithsonian Institution  

### APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS

* Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973
* (SI & NMAAHC to fill in more information here, as necessary)

### DIGITAL SERVICES MATURITY

In preparation for this project, approximately 8 SI individuals took a self-assessment using the Digital Service Maturity Determination Tool (https://techfarhub.cio.gov/learning-center/agile-maturity/) on 5/30/2019. The following provides average scores from that self-assessment. During the post-assessment discussion, the agency indicated that the self-scores were optimistic rather than reflecting current state.  

Transparency & Openness: 3.1 (adopted some practices)  
Organizational Culture of Delivery: 3.0 (adopted some practices)  
Craftsmanship: 3.25 (adopted some practices)  
Agile Development Championship: 3.25 (adopted some practices)  
User Centered Design: 2.9 (adopted some practices)  
Product Delivery:  2.9 (adopted some practices)  
Continuous Integration: 2.9 (adopted some practices)  
Clean Code: 2.9 (adopted some practices)  
Acquisition: 2.6  (in between awareness of some topics with limited adoption and adopted some practices)  

As of now, NMAAHC will have 4-5 people who will collectively serve as the Product Owner for this product. In previous situations, there could have been more people involved in this role. So this is an improvement.
