# DRAFT Statement of Objectives
## Smithsonian Institution National Museum of African American Museum of African American History and Culture
## Searchable Museum - Slavery and Freedom

### Problem Statement

SI NMAAHC's slavery and freedom exhibit is limited in both the amount of people it can reach and the quantity of objects, artifacts, information and stories it can share with others. Only so many people are able to visit the exhibit in Washington, DC, and the physical constraints of the exhibit only allow for a finite amount of objects, artifacts, information and stories.  

### Product Vision

Our digital product creates for the world (is this our users?) an engaging, emotional and educational digital experience of NMAAHC's (and partners?) body of knowledge for slavery and freedom (that took place in the United States of America between 1400 and 1877?), in a way that promotes discovery in an inclusive way, increases empathy, and helps understand our world (or just our country?) today.
