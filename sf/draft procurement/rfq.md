## Acquisition Strategies
_vendors - Which strategy makes the most sense? Are the pros and cons correct? Which pros and cons are missing? What additional strategies should we think about?_

#### Acquisition Strategy A (SI has chosen this strategy)  
One award for discovery, light-weight prototype (required tasks), then optional task to build an MVP for 8-12 month PoP, then multiple award terms to further develop the product.  
__Pros:__ Most simple procurement approach. Minimizes overhead to both SI and vendor.  
__Cons:__ Fewer ideas for discovery and light-weight prototype. Fewer opportunities to see new SI vendors deliver value, which could have been helpful if SI's vision is to build a number of additional digital products during the next few years.    

##### 1 award
* Overall Scope: digital product MVP and follow-on development
* Base Period
  * PoP: 4-8 weeks
  * Scope: Discovery sprint + light-weight prototype(s)
* Option Period 1
  * PoP: 6 months
  * Scope: Digital product MVP
* Award Term
  * PoP: 6 months
  * Scope: Further product development
* Award Term
  * PoP: 6 months
  * Scope: Further product development

#### Acquisition Strategy B (SI decided not to pursue this strategy)  
Multiple initial awards, then one larger award  
__Pros:__ Multiple initial light-weight prototypes  
__Cons:__ Potential delay or break in schedule between the end of first award and the beginning of larger award, leading to a dip in inertia. Multi-awards process would increase proposal and business development costs for vendors.  

##### ~~1. <=3 small awards (<=$30,000/award)~~
* ~~Scope: Discovery sprint + light-weight prototype~~
* ~~PoP: 2-4 weeks~~
##### ~~2. 1 larger award (ball park of team size = 8?)
* ~~Scope: digital product MVP and follow-on development~~
  * ~~Base Period~~
    * ~~PoP: 6-10 months~~
    * ~~Scope: Digital Prodcut MVP~~
  * ~~Award Term 1~~
    * ~~PoP: 6 months~~
    * ~~Scope: Further product development~~
  * ~~Award Term 2~~
    * ~~PoP: 6 months~~
    * ~~Scope: Further product development~~
  * ~~Award Term 3~~
    * ~~PoP: 6 months~~
    * ~~Scope: Further product development~~
  
#### Acquisition Strategy C (SI decided not to pursue this strategy)  
Multiple initial awards, where each awardee performs two initial tasks - discovery and a light-weight prototype - both within a brief initial PoP. After each awardee completes those initial taks, the agency will make a decision on which (only one) vendor continues work by only exercising the option period for one of the contracts. The others vendors option periods will not be exercised.

__Pros:__ Multiple initial light-weight prototypes. No procurement-related delay in performance between Task 1 (discovery and light-weight prototype) and subsequent tasks. Vendors get to deliver something of value, while getting paid, and getting to know the agency in the process. Compared to Acquisition Strategy B, Strategy C has reduced overhead costs for SI and vendors since this strategy is for 1 competition versus 2 competitions.  
__Cons:__ Potentially a staffing-related delay for the vendor in between Task 1 (discovery and light-weight prototype) and the next task due to the uncertainty of Option 1 being exercised.  

##### ~~<=3 awards~~
* ~~Overall Scope: digital product MVP and follow-on development~~
* ~~Base Period~~
  * ~~PoP: 2-4 weeks~~
  * ~~Scope: Discovery sprint + light-weight prototype~~
* ~~Option Period 1 (only one of the awardees will have this option exercised)~~
  * ~~PoP: 6 months~~
  * ~~Scope: Digital product MVP~~
* ~~Award Term~~
  * ~~PoP: 6 months~~
  * ~~Scope: Further product development~~
* ~~Award Term~~
  * ~~PoP: 6 months~~
  * ~~Scope: Further product development~~

## Period of Performance
The anticipated base Period of Performance (PoP) is 3 weeks from contract award date (anticipated __ ______ 2019) through __ ______ 2020.  
The majority of the work will be conducted offsite at the Vendor’s facilities, provided the Offeror has reliable remote communication capabilities and maintains regular agile ceremonies (Stand-Up, Sprint Demos, Sprint Retros, etc) with SI, at the direction of the Product Owner. Additionally, the Vendor should anticipate travel as necessary to support user research activities, in multiple geographic locations throughout the Continental United States (CONUS).
<br/><br/>

## Pricing
The Government anticipates an initial period of performance to be time and materials (T&M), followed by a firm-fixed price (FFP) contract type for the optional/award-term periods of performce. More specifically, the FFP periods will be FFP per iteration.

## How to Pitch and How to Be Judged

### How to Pitch
_vendors - What are we getting wrong here? Will this or another approach lead to a more effective way to both tell and show your capabilities to help solve the problem statement in the SOO? Please suggest alternative approaches. Is the lightness/heaviness of the'lift' and BD expense for you as a vendor appropriate at each phase yet effective enough to draw a line in the sand at the end of each stage? Should the advisory down-select be moved to a different stage? Removed all together?_ 
##### Phase 1  - Request for White Paper
* 7-page white paper
  * The focus here is around previous demonstrability of the Digital Services Playbook. Tell specific stories to show how your company (or individuals at your company) have brought those plays to life.
  * The Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture is seeking interested vendors to submit white papers in response to the needs addressed in this Statement of Objectives. The white paper should includes at least 2 projects that are not just relevant to the SOO, but also explain relevance to the [Digital Services Playbook](https://playbook.cio.gov/). For each project, explain the 'why', 'how', and 'what'. Interested vendors should prepare a response, no more than seven (7) pages including any exhibits or appendices, for submission no later than (month) (day), 2019 in accordance with the attached template. For each project, explain how your organization formed as one team with the client to deliver the product. For each project, explain how it contributed to the larger goal of improving the digital services ecosystem in Government. The Government will confirm receipt of each vendor’s white paper within 24 hours of submission; if you do not receive a confirmation in that period, please contact the Attorney/Advisor immediately. No submissions will be accepted after the deadline ((month) (day), 2019) regardless of circumstances.
* All vendors with questions must submit the questions, in writing, to the Attorney/Advisor by (month) (day), 2019. All questions, along with the Government responses, will be published to all participating vendors within 48 hours. The Government is unable to answer any questions privately or after these deadlines under Federal law and regulations.
* The Government will review white papers and select one or more vendors to continue in the process outlined below.

##### Phase 2 - Interviews/Meetings
* Interviews/Meetings can be in-person at NMAAHC or remote, and within approximately 2 weeks from submission of white papers
* Part 1 - 45 min Interview: questions and answers about your company and/or white paper
* Part 2 - 60 min Epic(s) Exercise: - Walk SI through, at least verbally, how you would approach the epic(s) provided to you at the end of Phase 1 when your organization was informed that it would continue in the process to Phase 2.
  * You will have between the end of Phase 1 and the Phase 2 Interviews/Meetings to put together a walk-through of how you would take one or several of the epic examples below from concept to production if you were working in the real environment. This should include at least design, user experience, and agile development process you would use to ensure successful implementation. You can focus on any particular part of the process you want to highlight and during the  time you may use props/supplies, or anything else that will help you highlight how your team would execute this example as if you were hired to complete it. You may not include any more team members than those that will be present (in person or virtually) with you to the Phase 2 interview/meeting.
    * Epic A: The epic will be provided at the end of Phase 1, and only provided to the vendors that are allowed to continue in the process to Phase 2. Indicate any assumptions made since you did not have access to SI for this process.
          * Acceptance Criteria: Use your creativity and come up with an appropriate acceptance criteria for this epic.
    * Epic B: The epic will be provided at the end of Phase 1, and only provided to the vendors that are allowed to continue in the process to Phase 2. Indicate any assumptions made since you did not have access to SI for this process.
          * Acceptance Criteria: Use your creativity and come up with an appropriate acceptance criteria for this epic.
* The Government will have a down-select at the end of Phase 2 and select one or more vendors to continue in the process outlined below.

##### Phase 3
* Due Diligence Session
* Technical Approach (to include resumes)
* Price
* Past performance/experience (not just corporate)

### How to be judged

#### Technical Evaluation Criteria
1. Technical Approach: The Government's confidence that the vendor's approach (including white paper submission, interviews/meetings, and technical approach submission) will successfully fulfill the Statements of Objectives and follow modern technology best practices, such as the Digital Services Playbook.
2. Price: (more content to be added here)
3. Past performance/experience: (more content to be added here)

### Other

__Award Term Incentive__  
For this task order the Government will offer Award Term Options which may encompass future enhancements, releases, development efforts, or operations & maintenance related to the establishment of the platform or the application. Award Terms may only be awarded for an overall “Excellent” performance rating based on mutually accepted metrics. The Government will appoint an Award Term Determining Official (AFDO) who will provide the official performance review and approval for an Award Term Option to be exercised. The AFDO, in conjunction with the Attorney/Advisor, will make a unilateral decision as to the exclusion of any portion of the performance period from the evaluation of ratings and calculation of the award term. Award Term Options are not required to be consecutive with the previous period of performance of the base period or additional options. They are contingent on continued Government requirements and funding availability for the platform or application. Award Term Options must adhere to the proposed Agile methodology and processes as awarded at the contract level unless an exception is provided by the Attorney/Advisor prior to award.  

__Other Direct Costs__  
The Vendor may recommend and procure major technical software development tools and resources necessary in support of the digital product maintenance and feature developments. The Vendor shall submit a minimum of three (3) competitive price quotes
to support the price quote submitted for expenditures supporting Offeror to the COR or
other SI Authorized Agent for review and validation of need prior to purchase. The Vendor shall obtain written electronic approval prior to proceeding with expenditures in support of the digital product, approval or denial shall be granted within 3 business days of receiving a request. Preference shall be given for open-source tools and resources with active community contribution and proven security reliability. In no event shall the Vendor be authorized to purchase equipment that exceeds the ODC amount funded on the contract.
