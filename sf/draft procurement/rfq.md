## Acquisition Strategies
_vendors - Which strategy makes the most sense? Are the pros and cons correct? Which pros and cons are missing? What additional strategies should we think about?_

#### Acquisition Strategy A  
One award for discovery, light-weight prototype (required tasks), then optional task to build an MVP for 8-12 month PoP, then multiple award terms to further develop the product.  
__Pros:__ Most simple procurement approach.  
__Cons:__ Fewer ideas for discovery and light-weight prototype. Fewer opportunities to see new SI vendors deliver value, which could have been helpful if SI's vision is to build a number of additional digital products during the next few years.  

##### 1 award
* Overall Scope: digital product MVP and follow-on development
* Base Period
  * PoP: 2-4 weeks
  * Scope: Discovery sprint + light-weight prototype
* Option Period 1
  * PoP: 6 months
  * Scope: Digital product MVP
* Award Term
  * PoP: 6 months
  * Scope: Further product development
* Award Term
  * PoP: 6 months
  * Scope: Further product development

#### Acquisition Strategy B  
Multiple initial awards, then one larger award  
__Pros:__ Multiple initial light-weight prototypes  
__Cons:__ Potential delay or break in schedule between the end of first award and the beginning of larger award, leading to a dip in inertia.    

##### 1. <=3 small awards (<=$30,000/award)
* Scope: Discovery sprint + light-weight prototype
* PoP: 2-4 weeks
##### 2. 1 larger award (ball park of team size = 8?)
* Scope: digital product MVP and follow-on development
  * Base Period
    * PoP: 6-10 months
    * Scope: Digital Prodcut MVP
  * Award Term 1
    * PoP: 6 months
    * Scope: Further product development
  * Award Term 2
    * PoP: 6 months
    * Scope: Further product development
  * Award Term 3
    * PoP: 6 months
    * Scope: Further product development
  
#### Acquisition Strategy C  
Multiple initial awards, where each awardee performs two initial tasks - discovery and a light-weight prototype - both within a brief initial PoP. After each awardee completes those initial taks, the agency will make a decision on which (only one) vendor continues work by only exercising the option period for one of the contracts. The others vendors option periods will not be exercised.

__Pros:__ Multiple initial light-weight prototypes. No procurement-related delay in performance between Task 1 (discovery and light-weight prototype) and subsequent tasks. Vendors get to deliver something of value, while getting paid, and getting to know the agency in the process.  
__Cons:__ Potentially a staffing-related delay for the vendor in between Task 1 (discovery and light-weight prototype) and the next task due to the uncertainty of Option 1 being exercised.  

##### <=3 awards
* Overall Scope: digital product MVP and follow-on development
* Base Period
  * PoP: 2-4 weeks
  * Scope: Discovery sprint + light-weight prototype
* Option Period 1 (only one of the awardees will have this option exercised)
  * PoP: 6 months
  * Scope: Digital product MVP
* Award Term
  * PoP: 6 months
  * Scope: Further product development
* Award Term
  * PoP: 6 months
  * Scope: Further product development

## How to Pitch and How to Be Judged

### How to Pitch
_vendors - What are we getting wrong here? Will this or another approach lead to a more effective way to both tell and show your capabilities to help solve the problem statement in the SOO? Please suggest alternative approaches. Is the lightness/heaviness of the'lift' and BD expense for you as a vendor appropriate at each phase yet effective enough to draw a line in the sand at the end of each stage? Should the advisory down-select be moved to a different stage? Removed all together?_ 
##### Phase 1  - Request for White Paper
* 5 page white paper
  * The focus here is around previous demonstrability of the Digital Services Playbook. Tell specific stories to show how your company (or individuals at your company) have brought those plays to life.
  * The Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture is seeking interested vendors to submit white papers in response to the needs addressed in this Statement of Objectives. Interested vendors should prepare a response, no more than ten (10) pages including any exhibits or appendices, for submission no later than (month) (day), 2019 in accordance with the attached template. The Government will confirm receipt of each vendorâ€™s white paper within 24 hours of submission; if you do not receive a confirmation in that period, please contact the Attorney/Advisor immediately. No submissions will be accepted after the deadline ((month) (day), 2019) regardless of circumstances.
* All vendors with questions must submit the questions, in writing, to the Attorney/Advisor by (month) (day), 2019. All questions, along with the Government responses, will be published publicly within 48 hours. The Government is unable to answer any questions privately or after these deadlines under Federal law and regulations.
* The Government will review white papers and select one or more vendors to continue in the process outlined below.

##### Phase 2 - Interviews
* Scenario-based interview focused on (1) discovery and prototyping, and (2) building digital MVPs
* Advisory down-select at the end of this

##### Phase 3
* Due Diligence Session
* Technical Approach
* Price
* Past performance/experience (not just corporate)
